- added feature to choose directory to store game logs (also creates folder)[issues when folder created has spaces]
- changed def collect_remaining_stones(self): to get remaining stones remaining if one side is empty (game ends)

If Player 1’s side (holes 0–6) becomes empty → the game ends immediately.

The remaining shells on Player 2’s side (holes 8–14) are collected into Player 2’s head (hole 15).

And vice versa:

If Player 2’s side (holes 8–14) becomes empty → the game ends.

The remaining shells on Player 1’s side (holes 0–6) are collected into Player 1’s head (hole 7).
